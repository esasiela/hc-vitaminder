## hc-vitaminder

A fun little project to create a reminder system for taking vitamins or medicine every day.  In my family, morning time is pretty much routine and we remember our medicine without any fuss.  Evening time is different and we frequently forget some very important stuff.

We COULD implement a simple reminder on our phones or whatever, but is that any fun?  NO!

Instead I'll build a little project that includes:

* Arduino device that has some colored lights for reminder, plus some input buttons to tell the system we've taken our meds.

* Python app running on Raspberry Pi Zero communicating via Bluetooth to the device.  All state info is maintained here.

* Future compatibility for web page access, android app, or whatever other fun comes up.
